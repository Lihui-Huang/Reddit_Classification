1.Data
The data are stored in 'data' folder, including training data and test data.

All the data processing are in the file 'feature_extraction.py', which deal with the raw data, transform them to IF*IDF features and then return design matrix 'X' and label vector 'y'.

4.Running
All the running codes are in 'main.py', where we run all the models we implemented.
