This is a brief introduction of this porject.

1.Models
All the models we implemented and tried are contained in the file 'models.py' as functions, our self implemented Bernoulli Naive Bayes is in 'NB.py'.

2.Data processing
All the data processing are in the file 'feature_extraction.py', which deals with the raw data, transform them to TF*IDF features and then return design matrix 'X' and label vector 'y'.

3.Running
All the running codes are in 'main.py', where we run all the models we implemented.
